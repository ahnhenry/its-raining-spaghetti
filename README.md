# It's Raining Spaghetti 🍝🎮

A fun, pixel-style browser game built with **HTML, CSS, and JavaScript**.  
Catch the falling spaghetti and meatballs while the song plays, but watch out for unexpected vomit moments that make it harder to see!  

## Gameplay

- Move your character **left/right** with the **arrow keys**.
- **Catch spaghetti and meatballs** to increase your score.
- You have **3 lives** (hearts). Missed food = lose a heart.
- If you lose all lives before the song ends → **Game Over**.
- If the song finishes and you still have lives → **You Win**!  
- Certain parts of the song trigger a **vomit overlay**, briefly making it harder to see the game.

## Controls

- **SPACE** → Start / Pause / Resume  
- **Arrow Left/Right** → Move character

## Assets & Credits

- Background and characters: **Original pixel art by [Your Name]**  
- Music: **"Spaghetti" by LE SSERAFIM**  

## How to Play

Open `index.html` in your browser. Works best on **mobile-sized resolution**, but the game scales for larger screens.
